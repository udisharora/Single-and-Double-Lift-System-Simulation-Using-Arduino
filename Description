Lift System README

Overview

This project simulates a dual-lift system controlled by an Arduino, featuring emergency handling, prioritized lift allocation, and floor-specific delay times. The system uses a LiquidCrystal_I2C LCD to display lift status and includes buttons for six floors and an emergency stop.

The lifts are powered using an L298 motor driver, and their movements are handled with pre-defined delay times to simulate travel between floors.

Features

	1.	Dual-Lift System:
	•	Two lifts are available to fulfill floor requests.
	•	Lift allocation prioritizes the closest lift or Lift 1 in case of a tie.
	2.	LCD Display:
	•	Real-time status updates, including current floor positions and lift movements.
	3.	Emergency Mode:
	•	An emergency button brings both lifts to Floor 1 immediately, overriding other operations.
	4.	Six-Floor Control:
	•	Buttons allow requests for any floor from 1 to 6.
	5.	Optimized Lift Movement:
	•	Hardcoded delay times simulate realistic travel durations between floors.
	•	The system calculates and selects the optimal lift for requests.

Hardware Components

	1.	Arduino UNO
	2.	LiquidCrystal_I2C LCD (16x2)
	3.	L298 Motor Driver
	4.	Buttons:
	•	6 floor request buttons (connected to digital pins 2–7).
	•	1 emergency button (connected to analog pin A0).
	5.	DC Motors:
	•	For lift movement (connected via motor driver).
	6.	Power Supply:
	•	External power for motors.

Pin Configuration

Lift 1

	•	Motor Control Pins:
	•	IN1: Pin 9
	•	IN2: Pin 8
	•	Enable Pin: Pin 10

Lift 2

	•	Motor Control Pins:
	•	IN3: Pin 12
	•	IN4: Pin 13
	•	Enable Pin: Pin 11

Floor Buttons

	•	Floor 1: Pin 7
	•	Floor 2: Pin 6
	•	Floor 3: Pin 5
	•	Floor 4: Pin 4
	•	Floor 5: Pin 3
	•	Floor 6: Pin 2

Emergency Button

	•	Pin: A0

Setup Instructions

	1.	Hardware Setup:
 
	•	Connect the DC motors to the L298 motor driver.
	•	Connect buttons for floors and emergency to the specified pins.
	•	Attach the LiquidCrystal_I2C LCD to the Arduino (I2C address: 0x27).
 
	2.	Code Upload:
 
	•	Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided code to the Arduino UNO.
 
	3.	Power Supply:
 
	•	Connect the Arduino to a 5V USB power source.
	•	Ensure the motor driver is powered by an appropriate external source.

Operating Instructions

	1.	Initialization:
	•	On power-up, the LCD will display:

LIFT SYSTEM READY
FLOORS: 1, 1

	•	Both lifts start at Floor 1.

	2.	Floor Requests:
 
	•	Press any floor button (1–6) to call a lift to the desired floor.
	•	The LCD will display the request and indicate which lift is moving.
 
	3.	Emergency Stop:
 
	•	Press the emergency button to activate emergency mode.
	•	Both lifts will immediately move to Floor 1, overriding all other operations.
	•	The LCD will display:

EMERGENCY MODE
RETURNING TO 1


	4.	Resume Operation:
	•	After the emergency is resolved, the system resets and resumes normal operation.

Example Scenarios

	1.	Request Floor 3:
	•	If Lift 1 is on Floor 1 and Lift 2 is on Floor 4:
	•	Lift 1 will move to Floor 3 (closer lift).
	•	LCD displays:

FLOOR REQ: 3
L1 MOVING...


	2.	Emergency Activation:
	•	Both lifts, regardless of their current floors, move to Floor 1.
	•	LCD displays:

EMERGENCY MODE
RETURNING TO 1

Customization

	1.	Delay Times:
	•	Modify the delayLift1 and delayLift2 matrices for different travel durations.
	2.	Motor Speed:
	•	Adjust the motorSpeed constant (0–255) for faster or slower movement.
	3.	Floor Count:
	•	Expand or reduce the number of floors by adjusting button pins and delay arrays.

Troubleshooting

	1.	LCD Not Displaying:
	•	Ensure the I2C address matches your LCD module.
	•	Confirm proper connections for SDA and SCL pins.
	2.	Lift Not Moving:
	•	Check motor driver connections and external power.
	•	Verify the motor pins are correctly defined in the code.
	3.	Emergency Mode Fails:
	•	Confirm the emergency button is connected to pin A0.
	•	Test the button functionality with a simple input reading sketch.

Enjoy using your Arduino-powered dual-lift system!
